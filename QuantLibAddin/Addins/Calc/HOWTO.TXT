1) Download and install LibreOffice with SDK (tested with version 4.4 and 5.0) 
2) Prepare for working with the LibreOffice SDK (execute setsdkenv_unix in the SDK directory and set path to executables - Java is not required)
3) Build boost libraries (if not provided by your distribution)
4) Build QuantLib, gensrc, log4cxx, ObjectHandler and QuantLibAddin
5) Set path to libraries (required by Makefile.oo)
 	export QL_PATH=/work/QuantLib
	export OH_PATH=/work/ObjectHandler
	export QA_PATH=/work/QuantLibAddin
	export LG_PATH=/work/log4cxx
	export BOOST_PATH=/usr/lib64
6) Add the library paths to the search path for libraries (add path to boost libraries if required)
	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$LG_PATH/src/main/cpp/.libs/
	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$QA_PATH/qlo/.libs
	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$OH_PATH/oh/.libs
	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$QL_PATH/ql/.libs
7) Go to QuantLibAddin/Addins/Calc
8) Change the PRJ variable of Makefile.oo to your needs (absolute path - use data from step 1)  
	PRJ=/opt/libreoffice4.4/sdk
9) Build the Addin (command: "make -f Makefile.oo")
